This is a simple repository to make some experiments to learn Next.js.

Check out the production build: [https://nextjs-ideas.vercel.app](https://nextjs-ideas.vercel.app)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 13
- React 18
- Typescript
- Vercel for deployment
- ESLint, Prettier

## Code Quality

If VSCode is your standard IDE, you can integrate Prettier to help you watch the inconsistencies. To do that, go to Settings and search for `Default Formatter`. In the droplist, choose the `Prettier - Code formatter` option. This configuration will help you to keep the code quality.

Another option to check the code quality is to run the command below. In case of any discrepancies, some warning/error messages will be displayed on the terminal.

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Pages

Route: `/reorder-text`
Description: This page is a simple React static application to revert a given text.
